# UpWork Clone API

A backend API for a freelance marketplace platform inspired by Upwork.  
This project is built with **NestJS**, **TypeORM**, and **SQLite**, and provides a secure authentication system with **JWT access tokens** and **refresh tokens** stored in the database.

The system supports two types of users:

- **CLIENT** – users who post jobs
- **FREELANCER** – users who apply for jobs

This project is designed with clean architecture principles and can easily scale into a production-ready freelance marketplace.

# Features
### Authentication System
* Secure authentication flow implemented using:
  - Access Tokens (short-lived)
  - Refresh Tokens (long-lived)
  - Token persistence in database
  - Token revocation support

* Authentication features include:
  - User registration
  - Login
  - Token refresh
  - Logout
  - LogoutAll

---
### Role Based Users
* Users have a role field:
  - CLIENT
  - FREELANCER

This allows implementing role-based permissions in the future.
Example use cases:

* CLIENT
  - create jobs
  - hire freelancers
* FREELANCER
  - browse jobs
  - send proposals
---

### Secure Password Handling
* Passwords are never stored in plain text.
**Implementation:**
  - Passwords hashed using **bcrypt**
  - Minimum password length validation
  - Secure comparison during login

---
### Token Management
* Refresh tokens are stored in the database.
**Token entity includes:**
  - tokenHash
  - expiration date
  - revocation flag
  - relation to user

* This allows:
  - logout from specific sessions
  - token invalidation
  - better security

# Entities

## User
* Represents a system user.
* Fields:
  - id
  - createdAt
  - updatedAt
  - email
  - password
  - role
  - name
  - surname
  - tokens relation
  - jobs ralation
  - proposals relation
---

## JobEntity

  - description
  - paymentType
  - price
  - category
  - skills
  - status
  - ManyToOne relation with user

  - revoke
  - user relation

---

## CommonEntity

# Authentication Flow

**Login process:**
1. User sends credentials
2. Server validates email and password
3. Server generates:
  - Access Token
  - Refresh Token
4. Access token is returned to client
5. Refresh token is stored in database and res.cookies

**Access Token:**
  - short lifetime
  - used for protected routes
**Refresh Token:**
  - longer lifetime
  - used to generate new access tokens

---

# Security Considerations

* This project implements several security practices:
  - Password hashing with bcrypt
  - Refresh token storage in database and cookie(http only)
  - Token revocation capability
  - Request validation using DTOs
  - Rate limiting with NestJS throttler

# Jobs Module
The Jobs module allows clients to publish work opportunities and freelancers to browse available projects.
A job represents a project posted by a client that freelancers can apply to.
* Typical job information includes:
```
| Field          | Description                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| id             | Unique identifier                        |
| title          | Job title                                |
| description    | Detailed job description                 |
| paymentType    | Type of payment (FIXED or HOURLY)        |
| price / budget | Budget allocated for the job             |
| category       | Job category                             |
| skills         | Required skills                          |
| createdAt      | Creation timestamp                       |
| client         | Reference to the user who posted the job |
```

### The platform supports two payment models:
**Fixed Price**
  - The client sets a fixed amount for the entire project.
**Hourly**
  - The client sets a budget range based on hourly work.

### Typical REST endpoints for jobs:
```
POST /jobs
Create a new job

GET /jobs
Get all jobs

GET /jobs/:id
Get a specific job

PATCH /jobs/:id
Update job

DELETE /jobs/:id
Delete job

```
* Authorization rules:
  - Only CLIENT users can create jobs
  - Only job owner can update or delete a job


# Proposals Module

* The Proposals module allows freelancers to apply for jobs posted by clients.
A proposal represents a freelancer’s offer to complete a job.

* A proposal contains the following information:
```
| Field         | Description                |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| id            | Unique identifier          |
| jobId         | Job reference              |
| freelancerId  | User who sent the proposal |
| coverLetter   | Message from freelancer    |
| bidAmount     | Proposed price             |
| estimatedDays | Estimated completion time  |
| status        | Proposal status            |
| createdAt     | Creation timestamp         |
```
* A proposal can have different statuses during its lifecycle.
  - PENDING
  - ACCEPTED
  - REJECTED
  - WITHDRAWN


* Proposal Endpoints (Typical)
```
POST /proposals
Send a proposal

GET /proposals/job/:jobId
Get proposals for a job

GET /proposals/user/:userId
Get proposals sent by a freelancer

PATCH /proposals/:id/status
